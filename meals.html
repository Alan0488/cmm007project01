        <h2>Chicken and Mushroom</h2>
        <p>Start by saut√©ing sliced mushrooms in butter until they're golden brown, then set them aside. In the same pan, cook seasoned chicken breasts until they're browned and cooked through. Remove the chicken from the pan and set it aside. Next, in the same pan, make a creamy sauce by adding minced garlic, chicken broth, heavy cream, and thyme. Let the sauce simmer until it thickens slightly. Finally, add the cooked mushrooms and chicken back to the pan, and let everything simmer together for a few minutes to meld the flavors. Serve hot with your favorite side dish, like rice or mashed potatoes, and enjoy your delicious chicken and mushroom dish!</p>
